            <p>I love my family more than I can express!  They are my world.  I have been married for five years and have three children ages 4, 2 and 8 months.  We live in Taylorsville, UT. We try to spend as much quality time together as possible by traveling and going on adventures.</p>

            <p>We love to travel!  Utah is an amazing place, and my family and I like to take full advantage of the beauty Utah has to offer.  We like to explore the mountains often, as well as Utah's national and state parks.  In addition to exploring various places around the U.S., we have also traveled to Mexico, specifically Mexico City area. We plan to continue broadening our travel horizons.  This photo was taken on our trip to Maui, Hawaii in 2015.</p>

            <p>I enjoy the outdoors and love to be out in nature.  As a family we enjoy camping, going on nature walks and hikes, swimming, playing all sorts of sports and gardening.  This picture was taken at Arch's National Park near Moab, Utah.</p>
